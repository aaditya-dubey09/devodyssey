3. In the email, please provide a clear description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and your contact information.
4. We will acknowledge receipt of your email within 48 hours.

We will keep you informed of our progress and, once the vulnerability is patched, we will coordinate with you on a public disclosure if you wish to be credited.
